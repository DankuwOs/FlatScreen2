# FlatScreen2
A *VTOL VR* mod that removes the VR, allowing you to play without a VR headset.

This is an extension of the original [FlatScreen mod by frdhog](https://vtolvr-mods.com/mod/zj7ylyrf/).

**NOTE:** This mod only allows for looking around and clicking on interactive elements. You will need to have a mod that allows for joystick inputs..

## Changes from original mod (not exhaustive)
- new mouse controls
- avatar body hiding
- NVG/visor is visible
- various minor bug/QoL fixes
