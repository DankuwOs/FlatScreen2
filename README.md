# FlatScreen 2
An update to a *VTOL VR* mod that can remove the VR, partially allowing for play without a VR headset.

This is an extension of the original [FlatScreen mod by frdhog](https://vtolvr-mods.com/mod/zj7ylyrf/).

**NOTE:** This mod only allows for looking around and clicking on interactive elements. You will need to have a mod that allows for joystick inputs.

## Changes from original mod (not exhaustive)
- can initialize with VR active
- new mouse controls
- avatar body hidden to more easily see cockpit
- HMCS and NVG now work properly
- less likely to require camera resetting
- certain options now save
- various minor bug/QoL fixes
